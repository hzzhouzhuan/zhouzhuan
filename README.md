I'm a clever boy. I'm from Hangzhou. This is my github, welcome to my github.

I'm not very good at C++, but I take interest in it, so if I do something wrong, just tell me, thank you!

Now let me to you something about myself:

1. first, (It's my pleasure), I'm in Wenlan Middle School, it's a very common private school, teachers in Wenlan Middle School are very kind and good.
I like them very much.

2. I am single. Then I can make more time in making procedures.(And I'm only thirteen years old)

3. I can spend whole day in one problem, because I don't want to afraid of any problems.
If it is too difficult to pass it, I will look it up in the internet. So I get stronger and stronger.

4. I like C++, languages in C++ are English. It helps my English a lot. I think I can learn more English in C++.

5. Now the world holds in internet, I think learning in internet is very useful and important, so typing C++ procedure is helpful for me.

That's my introduce, thank you very much.

I will do my best, fighting, Zhouzhuan!
